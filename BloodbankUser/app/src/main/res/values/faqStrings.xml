    <string name="q1">How does the blood donation process work?</string>
    <string name="a1">Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can bring about a huge change in the lives of others. The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about 30 minutes. The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.

The steps in the process are:
Registration
You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).
You will be asked to show your Aadhaar card as ID proof and all requisite details will be derived from that ID.

Health History and Mini Physical
You will answer some questions during a classified interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.
You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.

Donation
Experienced staff will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.
You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)
When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.

Refreshments
You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume.
After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities.
Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.
 
Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 90 days.</string>

    <string name="q2">What should I do after donating blood?</string>
    <string name="a2">After you give blood, take the following precautions:
– Drink an extra four glasses (about 250 ml each) of non-alcoholic liquids.
– Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.
– If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.
– Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm.
– Eat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet.

If you get a bruise: Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.
If you get dizzy or lightheaded: Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.
And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!</string>

    <string name="q3">Will it hurt when you insert the needle?</string>
    <string name="a3">Only for a moment. Pinch the fleshy, soft underside of your arm. That pinch is similar to what you will feel when the needle is inserted.</string>

    <string name="q4">How much blood do you take?</string>
    <string name="a4">Blood banks take only 350 ml- 450 ml of blood per individual.</string>

    <string name="q5">How long does a blood donation take?</string>
    <string name="a5">The entire process takes about 30 minutes; the actual donation of a whole blood unit takes eight to 10 minutes. However, the time varies slightly with each person depending on several factors including the donor’s health history and attendance at the blood donation center.</string>

    <string name="q6">How long will it take to replenish the unit of blood I donate?</string>
    <string name="a6">The plasma from your donation is replaced within about 24 hours. Red cells need about four to six weeks for complete replacement. That’s why at least eight weeks are required between whole blood donations.</string>

    <string name="q7">Why does the blood bank ask so many personal questions when I give blood?</string>
    <string name="a7">The highest priorities of any blood bank are the safety of the blood supply and their blood donors. Some individuals may be at risk of transferring communicable disease through blood donation due to exposure via travel or other activities or may encounter problems with blood donation due to their health. Blood banks ask these questions to ensure that it is safe for patients to receive your blood and to ensure that it is safe for you to donate blood that day.</string>

    <string name="q8">How often can I donate blood?</string>
    <string name="a8">You must wait at least twelve weeks (90 days) between donations of whole blood.</string>

    <string name="q9">Who can donate blood?</string>
    <string name="a9">In our country, donors must be age 18 or older. Donors must weigh at least 45 kgs and be in good health. Donors must also have a hemoglobin content no less than 12.5 gms/hundred ml.</string>

    <string name="q10">Why is one not allowed to donate blood before attaining the age of 18 years?</string>
    <string name="a10">Physiologically there is no harm if one satisfies other conditions for blood donation. 18 being the age of consent in our county, the reason is legal.</string>

    <string name="q11">Can one donate blood after 60 years of age if he/she is physically fit?</string>
    <string name="a11">Yes, medically speaking, there would be nothing wrong. However, with ageing, blood vessels start constricting. Bloodletting from constricted veins may lead to unnecessary pressure on hear resulting in many physiological problems. It is not known at what age blood vessels start constricting. It varies from individual to individual. Therefore, arbitrarily the retiring age is considered as the age of cutoff for blood donation.</string>

    <string name="q12">Can one donate blood if one’s body weight is less than 45 kg?</string>
    <string name="a12">Not desirable. But in extreme emergency, a marginal difference in weight to the tune of 1 to 2 kg is not harmful, so long as body weight x 8ml is above or equal to the volume of donation.</string>

    <string name="q13">Why blood is not collected from a person having a hemoglobin content of less than 12.5 gm/l00ml?</string>
    <string name="a13">The stipulated hemoglobin content of 12.5 gm/100 ml for a donor is the standard for a healthy person. Persons having less Hb content than the prescribed one cannot be treated as healthy donor having sufficient Hb for donations and hence are not allowed to donate blood. Further, blood weak in Hb content does not help the patient much in carrying oxygen to cells.</string>

    <string name="q14">Is it safe to give blood?</string>
    <string name="a14">Donating blood is a safe process. Each donor’s blood is collected through a new, sterile needle that is used once and then discarded. Although most people feel fine after donating blood, a small number of people may feel lightheaded or dizzy, have an upset stomach or experience a bruise or pain where the needle was inserted. Extremely rarely, loss of consciousness, nerve damage or artery damage occur.

    <string name="q15">Can I get HIV from donating blood?</string>
    <string name="a15">No. Sterile procedures and disposable equipment are used in all blood banks. They use a needle only once and then dispose of it. You cannot contract HIV or other viral disease by donating blood.</string>

    <string name="q16">What tests are administered to ensure my blood is safe to distribute to patients?</string>
    <string name="a16">Blood donations are tested for the following:
· ABO and Rh blood types.
· Jaundice (Hepatitis B and C)
· Malaria
· HIV (AIDS) test
· Venereal diseases (STDs)
· Before issuing blood, compatibility tests (cross matching) are done.
In addition, all platelet apheresis donations are tested for bacterial contamination.</string>

    <string name="q17">Why the above laboratory tests are not performed before donation?</string>
    <string name="a17">They are time consuming tests, and if performed at the blood bank before donation, there will be excessive delay in disposal of donors, and the disgusted donors may leave the camps and refrain from donating blood for ever. Besides, post donation tests are mandatory.</string>

    <string name="q18">What is apheresis?</string>
    <string name="a18">Apheresis is the process by which platelets and other specific blood components (red cells or plasma) are collected from a donor. The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.</string>

    <string name="q19">What are platelets and how are they used?</string>
    <string name="a19">Platelets are tiny, colorless, disc-shaped particles circulating in the blood, and they are essential for normal blood clotting. Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts. Platelets can only be stored for five days after being collected. Maintaining an adequate supply of this lifesaving, perishable product is an ongoing challenge.</string>

    <string name="q20">How often can I give platelets?</string>
    <string name="a20">Every 7 days up to 24 apheresis donations can be made in a year. Some apheresis donations can generate two or three adult-sized platelet transfusion doses from one donation!</string>

    <string name="q21">How long can blood be preserved in a blood bank?</string>
    <string name="a21">In India blood is normally preserved in blood bank for 35 days using CPDA or CPDA1 solution as anticoagulant.The maximum life span of RBC is 120 day.</string>

    <string name="q22">Why is then blood is preserved in blood bank for only 35 days?</string>
    <string name="a22">Donated blood contains cells ranging from 1 to 120 days’ life span. Naturally, cells having such varied life spans cannot be preserved for 120 days in the bag since in that case there will only be a few living cells Present. In order to get a considerable number of living cells present in the blood for transfusion, 35 days shelf life has been found to be optimum with CPDA and CPDA1 solution on the basis of various experiments. Furthermore, cells which can remain alive for 120 days within the human body cannot survive for such period in an artificial environment.</string>

    <string name="q23">Are blood substitutes available?</string>
    <string name="a23">No, there are currently no substitutes for blood. However, research is continually being done to identify new alternatives to blood transfusion.</string>
